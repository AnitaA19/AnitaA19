### Frontend Developer • UI Engineer • Builder of Fast, Beautiful Web Experiences

## 🌍 Turning Ideas Into Interfaces  
I’m a frontend developer who believes that great interfaces are more than visuals — they are experiences.  
I specialize in transforming concepts, wireframes, and product needs into elegant, high-performance applications powered by **React.js** and **TypeScript**.  

My work is guided by one principle:  
**Make everything feel fast, intuitive, and meaningful to the user.**

Whether I’m architecting a multi-layer state management system, animating a subtle UI interaction, or optimizing data flows, I aim for clarity, precision, and longevity in every line of code.

## 🎨 What I Love Building  
I enjoy crafting:

- Interfaces that feel *alive*  
- Components that scale effortlessly  
- User flows that eliminate friction  
- Designs that stay pixel-perfect no matter the screen  
- Architectures that stay clean long after v1  

My toolkit includes **React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, React Query, Vite, Tailwind CSS**, and an ever-growing collection of patterns that keep codebases maintainable and expressive.

## 🔧 Beyond Frontend  
While UI is my home, I understand the full picture.

Experience with **Node.js, Express, PHP, and MySQL** has given me the ability to think in terms of systems, not just screens.  
This helps me build frontends that communicate gracefully with backends, handle complex data, and stay stable under real-world demands.

Working with **Magento** and **Hyvä** strengthened my understanding of performance-heavy environments, where milliseconds matter and UX can’t ever break.

## 🧠 How I Think  
My background in **data structures, algorithms, and C++** shapes how I approach problems:  
methodically, intentionally, and with a focus on long-term maintainability.

I enjoy:

- untangling technical complexity  
- designing clean UI systems  
- solving problems with engineering precision  
- constantly refining my tools and practices  

I speak **English**, **Russian**, and **Georgian**, and I’m always exploring the frontier of modern frontend development.

## 🚀 What Drives Me  
I’m motivated by building things that feel good to use — the interfaces people enjoy without realizing why.  
The small details, the subtle interactions, the seamless flow — these are the things that define great products.

And those are the things I love creating.

## 🤝 Let’s Build Something Great  
If you're working on something ambitious — whether you need a sharp UI engineer, a frontend architecture thinker, or someone who can bring design and engineering together — I’d love to connect.
